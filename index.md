<p>
    
  I'm currently a device engineer at Cenfire, a Santa Barbara based startup, working on bringing to market a MEMS relay switch technology product. <br><br>

  Before that, I worked at Lam Research as a product engineeer on hardware and process engineering projects to help scale dry photoresist technology to HVM. <br><br>

  My academic background is in Chemical Engineering; I obtained a BS from The University of Arizona (2017) and PhD from UCLA (2022). <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br>
