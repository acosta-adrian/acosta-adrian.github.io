<p>
    
  I'm currently an Engineer at Lam Research in Fremont, CA. <br><br>

  As part of Lam's rotation program, I have gotten exposure to process engineering, hardware product engineering, and data engineering roles.  <br><br> 
  
  Before this, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in June of 2022. <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br>
