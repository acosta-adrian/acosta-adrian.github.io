  I'm currently a device engineer at Cenfire, a Santa Barbara based startup, working on scaling MEMS relay switch technology from concept to production. <br><br>

  My academic background is in Chemical Engineering, and I obtained my BS from The University of Arizona (2017) and a PhD from UCLA (2022). <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br>
