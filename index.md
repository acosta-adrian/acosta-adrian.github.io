<p>
  I'm currently a Process Engineer in a Concept & Feasability group at Lam Research in Fremont, CA. <br><br> 
  
  Before this, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in June of 2022. <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br> 
  
  I'll periodically post updates on personal projects outside of my job here.
