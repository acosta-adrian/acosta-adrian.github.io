<p>
    
  I'm currently a Product Engineer at Lam Research in Fremont, CA. <br><br>

  At Lam, I've contributed to projects across hardware product engineering, process engineering, and data science.  <br><br> 
  
  Before this, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in June of 2022. <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br>
