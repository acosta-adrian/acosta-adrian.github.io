<p>
    
  I'm currently a Product Engineer at Lam Research in Fremont, CA. <br><br>

  There I contribute to scaling Lam's CVD photoresist technology for EUV applications from concept to HVM.  <br><br> 
  
  Before this, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in June of 2022. <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br>
