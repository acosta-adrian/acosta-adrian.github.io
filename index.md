<p>
    
  I'm currently an Engineer at Lam Research in Fremont, CA. As part of Lam's rotation program, I started out as a Process Engineer in an Advanced Technology Development group before rotating to a Product Engineering role in an Etch Products Group. <br><br> 
  
  Before this, I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering at UCLA in June of 2022. <br><br> 
   
  I'm always seeking challenges, open to learning new things, and driven to make an impact. <br><br> 
  
  I'll periodically try to update personal projects outside of my job here.
