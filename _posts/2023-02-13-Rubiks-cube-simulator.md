I used to be obsessed with Rubik's cubes back in high school. I was never world class :p but after probably solving many thousands of Rubik's cubes I did get close to solving one in ~11 seconds on average.

At one point I took it as challenge to solve the worlds biggest rubik's cube (with dimensions of 121x121x121), which took me ~89h across several months. [You can read my blog post here from nearly a decade ago.](https://www.speedsolving.com/threads/uwr-121x121x121-largest-solve-ever.44193)

I'm often compelled to do things just for the challenge of it. Simulating a rubik's cube in excel is really inefficient but it was fun to do. The buttons in the spreadsheet are linked to a macro written in VBA for excel.
