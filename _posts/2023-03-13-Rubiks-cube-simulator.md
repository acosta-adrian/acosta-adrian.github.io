I'm using this post to archive a project I once did in a class on VBA for excel.

I took it as a challenge to simulate a Rubik's cube in excel.

The buttons in the spreadsheet are linked to a macro written in VBA for Excel. In the subroutines, the calculations are done with arrays that update the colors in the spreadsheet for the visualization of the faces.

There is both an unfolded visualization of the 6 faces of the rubiks cube as well as a 3d visualization that can be rotated to see the 'hidden' sides, since you can only see three faces of the cube at a time. It also has a timer and automatic scrambler.

The excel file is uploaded at this [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nnwb1gjeoduzayam84jur/Rubiks-Cube-Simulator.xlsm?dl=0&rlkey=lqtn6azjisgf35uobv07towu2).
